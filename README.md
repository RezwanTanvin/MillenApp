# MillenApp : The Millennial Power App 
Personal Project: Attempting to make a super productivity app. 
The app currently has 3 active functions: 
a To Do List, Grocery List and a Notes Section. 
I will overtime complete the rest of the sections. 
My future plans are to add the following sections:
Things to Buy, Workout List, Movies to Watch, Expenses (Budgeting) and Stock Exchange Portfolio. 
These are areas where I use separate apps and would love it if I had one app that took care of everything. Thus took birth, this project. 
Please, feel free to contribute to the code in any way you can. 
I would also appreciate any criticism/comments about  the quality of my code.

I have learnt a great deal of things over time. This is my way of thanking the world and passing on my knowledge. Alot of the features in this app will be a direct result of my life choices. 

Have a good day reader. Thanks for your time.
