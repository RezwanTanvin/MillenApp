# MillenApp
Personal Project : attempting to make a super productivity app. 
The app currently has 3 functions active:
To Do List, Grocery List, Notes Section. 
I will overtime try to complete the rest of the sections. 
My future plans are to add the following sections:
Things to Buy, Workout List, Movies to Watch, Expenses (Budgeting), Stock Exchange Portfolio.
These are areas where I use seperate apps, and would love it if I had one app that took care of everything. Thus took birth this project. 
Please, feel free to contribute to the code in any way you can. 
I would also appreciate any critisism/comments about my quality of code.
